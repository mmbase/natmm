This folder is intentionally left empty (except for the stock.xml builder and this readme.txt).

The other builders for the Breedveld application have to be copied manually from the other application folders to the config/builders/applications folder.
See the <neededbuilderlist> in Breedveld.xml for the builders you have to copy, next to the builders of LeoCMS/builders.
