This folder is intentionally left empty (except for this readme.txt).

The builders for the VanHam application have to be copied manually from the other application folders to the config/builders/applications folder.
See the <neededbuilderlist> in VanHam.xml for the builders you have to copy, next to the builders of LeoCMS/builders.
