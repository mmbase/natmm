This folder is intentionally left empty (except for this readme.txt).

The builders that have to be copied to this directory depend on the application you want to deploy.

1. For all applications: copy the builders from config/applications/LeoCMS/builders to this folder.
2. Next to the LeoCMS builder you should copy the builders listed in the <neededbuilderlist> section of the application file to be deployed.
